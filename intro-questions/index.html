			<li>Alex Koehl, Communication Design, Junior</li>
			<li>I'm taking this class as a major requirement, but am definitely interested in UI design as a career path.</li>
			<li>I took an html and css class freshman fall, but haven't interacted with these languages since.</li>
			<li>I hope to learn enough to work more efficiently in programs like webflow.</li>
			<li>Interactions will be different than on paper.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.instrument.com/">Instrument</a>This website has very clear hierarchy, interactions and high contrast.</li>
			<li><a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/">AIGA eye on design</a> With this website, the CTAs and nav are very clear. The way content is written and laid out makes it very simple and easy to follow.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.adweek.com/">AdWeek</a>The AdWeek site works well because it's design is responsive to all screeen sizes, and it follows a grid structure.</li>
