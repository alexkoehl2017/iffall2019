<h1>Aesthetic</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The design looks the best on the first</li>
		<li>The second postcard does the best job of relating to the design to the concept. The first desktop works as well.</li>
		<li>The imagery works well across the board to support the text. The first image doesn't totally mirror the text, but still works.</li>
		<li>Each pne has a slightly different aesthetic, but only in type treatment, and how she chose to differentiate from the background. All images feel consistent.</li>
		<li>Aesthetic seems to drive the concept, but isn't working alone.</li>
		<li>I think the type style on the first is the best, but could use a drop shadow. Will most likely need in other postcards as well. Maybe a blur or color fade.</li>
	</ul>
<h1>Structure</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Text seems to come to the foreground, but doesn't really take it over. Kinda share foreground with the subjects.</li>
		<li>Seems like they may be tough on mobile</li>
		<li>No transparency used, but could be helpful in making the text standout from the background.</li>
	</ul>
<h1>Technical Challenges</h1>
	<ul>
		Not sure on this yet, because there no sizes in-between yet.
	</ul>
<h1>General Feedback</h1>
	<ul>
		Postcard one is the most legible, while desktop 2 has the best image to text relationship. May need to include either drop shadows, color overlays or blur in order to help the text standout more in all three of them. Also, the high contrast white type in the first helps with legibility, so maybe staying away from colored type will help with legibility.
	</ul>
