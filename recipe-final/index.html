		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul class="ingredient-list">
			<li><strong>1</strong> pound dry spaghetti</li>
			<li><strong>2</strong> tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
			<li><strong>4</strong> ounces pancetta or slab bacon, cubed</li>
			<li><strong>4</strong> garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
			<li><strong>2</strong> large eggs</li>
			<li><strong>1</strong> cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
			<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li><strong>1</strong> handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="direct">1</span> Prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking to ensure that the spaghetti will be hot and ready when the sauce is finished; it is very important that the pasta is hot when adding the egg mixture so that the heat of the pasta cooks the raw eggs in the sauce.
			</li>
			<li><span class="direct">2</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender yet firm (as they say in Italian “al dente.”) Drain the pasta well, reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water to use in the sauce if you wish.
			</li>

			<li><span class="direct">3</span> Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium flame. Add the pancetta and saute for about 3 minutes, until the bacon is crisp and the fat is rendered. Toss the garlic into the fat and saute for less than 1 minute to soften.
			</li>
			<li><span class="direct">4</span> Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the pan and toss for 2 minutes to coat the strands in the bacon fat. Beat the eggs and Parmesan together in a mixing bowl, stirring well to prevent lumps. 
			</li>
			<img src="images/eggs.jpg" alt="beating eggs and cheese">
			<li><span class="direct">5</span> Remove the pan from the heat and pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta, whisking quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble (this is done off the heat to ensure this does not happen.) 
			</li>
			<li><span class="direct">6</span> Thin out the sauce with a bit of the reserved pasta water, until it reaches desired consistency. Season the carbonara with several turns of freshly ground black pepper and taste for salt.
			</li>
			<li><span class="direct">7</span> Mound the spaghetti carbonara into warm serving bowls and garnish with chopped parsley. Pass more cheese around the table.
			</li>
