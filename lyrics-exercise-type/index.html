	<section><h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
	<p>Oh peach pit where'd the hours go</p>
	<p>When your orange skin began to glow</p>
	<p>From a hanging branch in gardens home</p>
	<p>Not much is hidden underneath</p>
	<p>A rocky heart for breaking teeth</p>
	<p>And apple cores cyanide seed</p></section>
	<section class="Chorus"><h3>[Chorus]</h3>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>All this rotting fruit with you</p>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>This rotting fruit with you</p></section>
	<section><h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
	<p>Lift back and see the darkness hid</p>
	<p>Swallowed up and angled in</p>
	<p>Looking back at sweetness dim</p>
	<p>Ripe June had leaf and shady friend</p>
	<p>The cool air is gone again</p></section>
	<section class="Chorus"><h3>[Chorus]</h3>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>All this rotting fruit with you</p>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>This rotting fruit with you</p></section>
	<section><h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
	<p>Oh peach pit where'd the hours go</p>
	<p>When your orange skin began to glow</p>
	<p>From a hanging branch in gardens home</p></section>
	<section class="Chorus"><h3>[Chorus]</h3>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>All this rotting fruit with you</p>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>This rotting fruit with you</p>
	<p>It's been a long season through</p>
	<p>All this rotting fruit with you</p></section>
