	<h1>Feedback from Priya on Alex Koehl's Wiredrame</h1>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Distinguish the number from the directions (especially since I used big numbers for the ingredients) </li>
		<li>Directions are fairly involved so some in-process photos may help people out</li>
		<li>Possibly higher contrast on the color, but is still readable.</li>
		<li>Can break up portions of the steps and determine new step levels, cause some of them are pretty THICK</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Next Steps</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Add a space below the step numbers</li>
		<li> Find and place in-process photos of the recipe</li>
		<li> Explore different weights or colors for the text</li>
		<li> Re-read directions and find meaningful breaks to create breaks for more approachable text</li>
	</ul>
